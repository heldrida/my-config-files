# ðŸŒˆ Config files ðŸ¦„

The `~/.config` repository to keep track of the state of my system configuration and mainly customisation settings, which previously existed in separate repositories.

By migrating to new machines, found that it takes a bit too long to follow, as such using a monorepository to represent all seems more appropriate.

During the time of creation it was setup by:

- ZSH
- Antigen zsh package manager
- OMZ (although, not recommended by #zsh community)
- Starship.rs (shell prompt)

# Fonts

There's also detailed information about the fonts used, in the context of the terminal emulator Kitty which supports it.
